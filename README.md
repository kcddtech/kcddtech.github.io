[Testpdf:D](https://kcddtech.github.io/imgonline-com-ua-ReplaceColor-0UcyTSFTRNXDLJDH.pdf) 

this is to shorten the link, so you just have to press the "Testpdf:D"

If you upload more than one pdf, you will find out, that the lines will just continue and it will be hard to seperate the link.

This can be fixed by typing "<br/>) after the line
